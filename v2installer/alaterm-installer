# Alaterm: Arch Linux ARM in Termux.
# Copyright and MIT License at bottom of this file.
declare repository=https://github.com/cargocultprog/alaterm
declare versionID=2.2.0 # Updated September 23, 2020.
let thisRevision=220 # 220 in version 2.2.0.
##

## DEVICE REQUIREMENTS:
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# * Device must have ARM processor and Android 8 or later operating system.
#     Includes most phones, tablets, and Chromebooks. Not Apple or Microsoft.
# * Requires the Termux app, by Fredrik Fornwall.
#     Optional, additional capabilities if Termux:API is added.
# * Requires the VNC Viewer app, by RealVNC.
##

## USAGE:
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# * Script usage within Termux:
#     bash alaterm-installer ACTION
#       where ACTION is one of: install remove help version
#       may be abbreviated as: i r h v
# * Interactive script. May require user response from time to time.
#     If lucky, you can let it run by itself, after the first few minutes.
# * Total installation time may take 40-60 minutes, depending on Internet.
# * This script does not update an existing installation.
#     For updates, use: bash update-alaterm
##

## LONG DESCRIPTION:
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# * Arch Linux ARM is a modern Linux distribution compiled for ARM processors.
#   Most Linux distros are not compiled for ARM, or their ARM version is old.
# * Alaterm installs portions of Arch Linux ARM into the Termux app.
#   It merely adds software to Termux. It does not change Termux itself.
# * Alaterm does not make device or system alterations. No root access.
#   If you remove Alaterm, your device will never know it was there.
# * Alaterm works with small screens and touchscreen-only devices,
#   but the benefits are best realized when the screen is 10.1 inches or more,
#   and you have a keyboard and mouse. Works with Bluetooth.
# * Alaterm is optimized for ordinary users who want a desktop environment.
#   You will be able to run programs such as GIMP and LibreOffice.
#   However, audio and multimedia are controlled by Android, not Alaterm.
# * Alaterm does not contain software for pentest, hacking, or rooting.
#   Although experts may be able to add such software, it is discouraged.
# * The Alaterm installer begins by measuring your device properties.
#   If your device is incompatible, it will be rejected.
# * Alaterm is not a dual-boot. It runs in Termux, within Android.
#   While you work in Alaterm, Android apps can play music and monitor Email.
#   You can multi-task, switching between Alaterm and other Android windows.
#   This capability is limited by available device resources.
# * Alaterm can be run as Termux command-line, without GUI.
#   To see the GUI desktop, Termux and VNC Viewer must both be running.
