<p class="break">The TeX typesetter works well
via command-line, or with TeXworks GUI.
Since TeX is rarely used by anyone other than doctoral candidates in
Mathematical Physics, this help only provides a general guide.
Proof left to student.</p>

<p>If you already have a good, working installation of TeXLive in Termux,
keep it. You may be able to use Termux command-line TeX programs
while you are in Alaterm, but this is not guaranteed. You can try it.
If it works, good for you. If it fails, do not report it as a bug.
You can still install TeXLive in Alaterm.</p>

<p class="top">^<a href="#h">TOP</a>^</p>


<h4 id="h7.1">7.1. Installing TeXLive via pacman</h4>

<p class="noindent">In Alaterm, you can install a native version of TeXLive.
There are several package names, with more or less content. Best choice:</p>
<p class="code"><code>pacman -S texlive-most</code></p>
<p>Then choose the number(s) that you need. If you wish to add more later,
simply re-run the above command, and choose again.</p>
<p class="listhead">If pacman <code>tlmgr</code> does not allow you to
install or update native TeX packages,
then have a look at <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TeX_Live">
this web page</a> for solutions.
No problem with TeXLive from TUG.</p>

<p class="top">^<a href="#h">TOP</a>^</p>


<h4 id="h7.2">7.2. Installing TeXLive from TUG online</h4>

<p class="noindent">As an alternative to the pacman installation, you can install TeXLive
via the downloaded online installer, directly from the TUG web site:</p>
    <p class="li">a) Do not install both the native package, and the one from TUG.
Choose one or the other.</p>
    <p class="li">b) Get <code>install-tl-unx.tar.gz</code> from
<a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html">TUG</a>.</p>
    <p class="li">c) Unpack it in Alaterm home, using Alaterm software. Do not unpack using Android tools.</p>
    <p class="li">d) Enter the directory containing <code>install-tl</code>. Then:</p>
<p class="code"><code>sudo perl install-tl</code></p>
    <p class="li">e) The correct binaries may be labeled armhf-linux, armv6, or similar.
If the label does not exactly match your ARM architecture, no problem.
But certainly do not use i386, x86_64, or Mac.</p>
    <p class="li">f) Carefully choose only what you need, from among the schemes
and packages. The default tries to install everything.</p>
    <p class="li">g) You almost certainly do not need to install the src tree.
Unless you habitually work offline, you can save a lot of space by
not installing the doc tree. Documentation for individual packages
can be obtained by reinstalling them later, as needed:</p>
<p class="code"><code>sudo tlmgr install --reinstall --with-doc <i>texpackagename</i></code></p>
    <p class="li">h) The default TEXMFHOME directory is visible in your home folder.
If you are in the habit of cleaning out files there, then change it to
a hidden directory such as <code>~/.texmf-home</code>.</p>
    <p class="li">i) IMPORTANT: Choose "create symlinks in standard directories."
That will be <code>/usr/local/bin</code> for the binaries, and similar
for the others. This is superior to editing PATH, because some programs
ignore PATH and only look in expected locations.</p>
<p class="li2">To test whether you
did this correctly, command <code>which latex</code> immediately after
completing the installer, before re-launching Alaterm.
If it does not find <code>latex</code>, re-install with the symlinks.</p>
<p class="li">j) To avoid the need to remember <code>sudo</code> whenever
you use <code>tlmgr</code>, you can add this line to
~/.bashrc : <code>alias tlmgr='sudo tlmgr'</code>

<h4 id="h7.3">7.3. TeXworks GUI</h4>

<p class="noindent">Alaterm has three TeX GUI programs:
TeXworks, TeXmaker, TeXstudio.
Of these, TeXworks is simplest and best:</p>
<p class="code"><code>pacman -S texworks</code></p>
<p>Sadly, TeXworks cannot save its preferences. Cause unknown.
For this reason, the Alaterm installer creates a useful set of preferences
at <code>/home/.config/TUG/TeXworks.conf</code>.
You may edit it in a text editor, if you prefer different preferences.
Changed preferences have no effect until TeXworks is re-launched.</p>

<p class="top">^<a href="#h">TOP</a>^</p>


<h4 id="h7.4">7.4. Spell-check and dictionaries</h4>

<p class="noindent">If you use TeXworks, its editor window can spell-check,
with an appropriate <b>hunspell</b> dictionary installed:</p>
<p class="code"><code>pacman -S hunspell hunspell-<i>xx_YY</i></code></p>
<p>where xx_YY is your locale, such as en_US or fr_FR. You can also install
several dictionaries, then choose from within TeXworks.</p>

<p class="top">^<a href="#h">TOP</a>^</p>


<h4 id="h7.5">7.5. Viewing the PDF</h4>

<p class="noindent">3.6.5 TeXworks can view PDF internally.
Or, PDF files can be viewed by the built-in <b>Evince</b> program,
called "Document Viewer" in the LXDE Menu.</p>

<p class="top">^<a href="#h">TOP</a>^</p>


<h4 id="h7.6">7.6. Fonts in TeXLive</h4>

<p class="noindent">The Lua(La)TeX engine can automatically detect and use
<b>otf</b> and <b>ttf</b> fonts in Alaterm. If you are using it, then you must
refresh its internal font database after installing any new fonts.
This is a TeXLive procedure, not specific to Alaterm:</p>
<p class="code"><code>luaotfload-tool --cache=erase</code></p>

<p>In a few cases, a problem arises when an Alaterm system font is also distributed within TeX.
Even though the font name (internal to the font file)
is identical, the filename may differ from the one stored in
the TeXLive database. Then TeX is confused.
You can fix this in one of two ways:</p>

    <p class="li">The hard way: Re-name the Alaterm system files to whatever TeX expects.
Often this involves case-sensitive. For example, a system file may be
named <i>SomeFont-Italic.otf</i> but TeX expects <i>somefont-italic.otf</i>.
After re-naming the files, update the system and TeX font caches:</p>
<p class="code"><code>fc-cache</code></p>
<p class="code"><code>mktexlsr && updmap-sys</code></p>
<p class="code"><code>luaotfload-tool --cache=erase</code></p>

    <p class="li">The easy way: Install the fonts into TeX.
Then TeX will find its own fonts and be happy,
but other Alaterm programs will not see them there.
Search online for the names of TeX font packages,
and how to install them into TeX.</p>
