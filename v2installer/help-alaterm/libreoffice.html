<h3 id="h3">5. LibreOffice</h3>


<p class="break">You can install the LibreOffice suite.
It comes in two versions:</p>
<p class="code"><code>pacman -S libreoffice-still</code> # stable</p>
<p class="code"><code>pacman -S libreoffice-fresh </code> # recent</p>

<p class="break">Do not use Java or its runtime.
Android uses Java, and there is likely to be a conflict.</p>

<p class="break">But before you install the very large LibreOffice suite:
Are you sure you need it?
Have you tried the <b>Collabora</b> app from Google Play Store?</p>

<p>Android has many native apps that can create documents,
show slide presentations, calculate spreadsheets,
and even maintain a small database.
Many of them are linked to "cloud" storage via Microsoft or Google,
or other providers. In some cases, your little device sends information
to the great computer in the sky, which does the heavy work for you,
saves the information, and returns processed results to you.</p>

<p>The only reason to use LibreOffice locally is if you are not often
connected to cloud storage, or you have existing documents
that must use the LibreOffice file formats, or you are so familiar with
the desktop program that you wish to work in the same environment.</p>

<p class="break">The LXDE Menu will show LibreOffice, and LibreOffice Writer.
The other LibreOffice programs are there, but not shown on the Menu.
Launching the main LibreOffice provides a choice.</p>

<p>LibreOffice is designed for desktop computers with large resources.
Do not dream of creating a massive relational database on your device.</p>

<p>You might or might not be able to print to a Bluetooth printer.
You can definitely export files to PDF, move the PDF
to where Android can see it, then print from there.</p>

<p>After installing LibreOffice, logout of Alaterm, then relaunch it.</p>
