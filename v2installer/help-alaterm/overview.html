<h4 id="h1.1">1.1. What is Alaterm?</h4>

<p>Alaterm is an Android-specific customized installation of
<a href="https://archlinuxarm.org/">Arch Linux ARM</a>,
which is a version of Arch Linux compiled for the ARM CPU architecture.</p>

<p>Alaterm is not a Linux distribution. It does not provide software.
It installs software provided by others, then configures the software.</p>

<p>Unlike the independent TermuxArch project,
Alaterm is specifically configured for the benefit of desktop software users,
rather than programmers.</p>

<p>Alaterm allows you to run the graphical LXDE Desktop, visible with the
VNC Viewer app at connection 127.0.0.1:5901.</p>

<p class="top"><a href="#h">^TOP^</a></p>


<h4 id="h1.2">1.2. How does Alaterm affect Termux and Android?</h4>

<p>Alaterm is <i>not</i> an Android app. To use Alaterm, you need Termux,
which <i>is</i> an Android app.</p>

<p>Alaterm sits entirely within Termux.
If you uninstall Termux, you lose Alaterm.</p>

<p>After Alaterm is installed, Termux features are the same as before.
In case of problems, Alaterm files can be edited by Termux.</p>

<p>Alaterm does not affect your Android desktop.</p>

<p>You can multi-task. Android is active at all times,
and manages WiFi and Bluetooth. While Alaterm is running,
you can summon an Android Email app,
or listen to an Android music app, or use an Android web browser.</p>

<p>Alaterm is not a dual-boot.
It does not "root" your device, or jailbreak it.
If you have rooted your device on your own initiative,
then the consequences of using Alaterm are unknown.</p>

<h4 id="h1.3">1.3. What can Alaterm do?</h4>

<p>The installed software provides the essential elements
of a graphical desktop. When viewed in VNC Viewer, you will see wallpaper,
taskbar, Menu, and file manager.
If using a mouse, right-click will display context menus.</p>

<p>The screen is touch-sensitive,
and will work on many small devices such as phones.
However, the benefits of Alaterm are best with a large tablet,
external keyboard, and mouse.</p>

<p>Some basic utility programs are pre-installed: calculator, font viewer,
PDF viewer, text editor, programming editor, image viewer,
web browser, preferences manager.</p>

<p>From the command line. you can install additional software,
including many programs with advanced features.
They will almost always look and operate the same way
as they do on a laptop computer.</p>

<p>Be warned that due to limited resources,
your device cannot have too many apps running at the same time.
If overloaded, Android may close Termux. So if you multi-task,
be sure to save your work in Alaterm before doing something else.</p>

<p class="top"><a href="#h">^TOP^</a></p>


<h4 id="h1.4">1.4. What cannot be done by Alaterm?</h4>

<p>If Android security prohibits Termux from doing something,
then Alaterm cannot do it. In particular,
software requiring a service or daemon is unlikely to work.</p>

<p>You cannot use a <b>cups</b> printer, but most useful applications can
export either PDF or images. Then you can print using another Android app,
or copy the files to removable media such as a USB pendrive.</p>

<p>You cannot mount a CD player, DVD player, or external hard drive,
unless Android can mount them and they are shared. This is unlikely.
However, you can mount a USB pendrive or removable SDcard,
if your device has the necessary connections.
You can also transfer files via Bluetooth.</p>

<p>Alaterm is not configured for sound. Very few audio programs work properly,
and it requires considerable effort to configure them.
If your purpose is multimedia,
then just do it with Android apps, not Alaterm.</p>

<p>The graphical Trash (Rubbish) Bin does not work.
There is a Trash folder, but its
contents can only be managed via command line.</p>

<p class="top"><a href="#h">^TOP^</a></p>


<h4 id="h1.5">1.5. Passwords and Security</h4>

<p>Every part of Alaterm can be manipulated directly from Termux.
There is no point to having secure passwords in Alaterm,
because they can be changed without permission.</p>

<p>In Alaterm, your username is <b>user</b> and its password is
<b>password</b>. Login is automatic,
so you will not be asked for username or password.</p>

<p>When connecting to VNC viewer, the network password is <b>password</b>.</p>

<p>Only on rare occasions will you need to use <b>sudo</b>
to obtain a higher level of privilege. No password is required.</p>

<p>Only on the rarest occasions (probably never)
will you need to use <b>su</b> to become the root user.
Its password is <b>root</b>. Note that this is only internal to Alaterm.
It does not root Android.</p>
