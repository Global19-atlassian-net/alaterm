<h4 id="h4.1">4.1. Viewing images</h4>

<p class="break">The GPicView program is pre-installed.
You can invoke it from the Menu as "Graphics/Image Viewer"
or use the file manager to right-click on the icon of an image file.</p>

<p>GPicView is fast, but does not edit images beyond horizontal/vertical
rotation.</p>

<h4 id="h4.2">4.2. Image editors</h4>

<p class="break">Image editors can consume a lot of resources.
Whenever you create or edit a large image, close unneccessary Android apps,
and only work on one image at a time.
If the editor allows layers, keep the number of layers small.</p>

<p>If the file is on removable media (detachable SD card, USB pendrive),
first copy the file to your device internal storage, and edit it there.
If you attempt to manipulate a file directly on removable media,
the application may crash. This has to do with Android file security.</p>

<p class="li"><a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>
is up-to-date, with full capabilities. Others will envy you.</p>
<p class="code"><code>pacman -S gimp</code></p>

<p class="li"><a href="https://mypaint.org/">MyPaint</a>
does many things, and is simpler than GIMP.</p>
<p class="code"><code>pacman -S mypaint</code></p>

<p class="li"><a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>
is a powerful svg vector drawing program.</p>
<p class="code"><code>pacman -S inkscape</code></p>

<p class="li"><a href="https://imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>
and <a href="https://graphicsmagick.org/">GraphicsMagick</a>
are command-line image editors that can perform a great variety of tasks.
They are widely used when image handling must be automated by script.</p>
<p class="li2">Since they are command-line programs without GUI,
be sure to look at their documentation for the command syntax,
or use Internet search for various how-to tricks.</p>
<p class="code"><code>pacman -S imagemagick</code></p>
<p class="code"><code>pacman -S graphicsmagick</code></p>

<p class="li"><a href="https://hugin.sourceforge.net">
Hugin</a> is a panorama photo stitcher.
However, photo stitching is inherently demanding of memory, CPU,
and read-write temporary file access.
You may find that Hugin is too much for your device.</p>
<p class="li2">Also, the stitched result may require specific software
to view it properly. Not everyone has a suitable app installed.</p>
<p class="code"><code>pacman -S hugin</code></p>

<h4 id="h4.3">4.3. HEIC/HEIF, h265</h4>

<p class="break">Many modern handheld devices save screenshots
and photos in <b>heic/heif</b>
format, also known as <b>h265</b>. This is especially true for Apple phones.
At the time I write this, the native Alaterm software for handling
heif/heic is rejected by Android security policies.
This is not a fundamental problem. Perhaps it will be fixed in the future,
if the Arch Linux ARM project does it.
In the meantime, you have choices:</p>

<p class="li">a) If you absolutely must open or save heic/heif still images
within Alaterm, you can compile the fixed version of the necessary software,
<b>libde265</b>. The compiler suite takes up about 250MB space,
and compilation takes about 25 minutes.
For your convenience, Alaterm includes a script that does it all:<br/>
<code>compile-libde265</code></p>

<p class="li">b) If you have Android 9 or later (not sure about 8),
then there are numerous Android apps capable of opening heic/heif
and exporting or saving to another
format such as jpeg. Some of them will also convert jpeg to heic/heif.</p>

<p class="li">c) There are online image converter services.
Upload the heic/heif, then download the image converted to jpeg or whatever.
Also works in reverse.</p>
