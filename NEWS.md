### NEWS for Alaterm

Alert: On September 27, 2020, the developer erroneously uploaded
a developer-only update file. It was removed within a few hours.
If you grabbed that update and applied it, your Alaterm may fail.
This is fixed in update 223. No harm done.

Be sure to read the revised UPDATE.md file.
Note that updates are applied when Alaterm is NOT running.

On September 10, 2020, a change in Tigervnc software caused a bug in Alaterm.
New Alaterm installations would fail to launch the LXDE Desktop.
Existing Alaterm installations, previously working, would fail.
This problem was not unique to Alaterm.

NATURE OF PROBLEM: Some programmer fixed what wasn't broken.

NATURE OF SOLUTION: Alaterm developer whacked it with a sledge hammer,
then danced around the pieces while reciting voodoo chants.

The solution is likely to be permanent.
Your friendly Alaterm developer does not know much about programming,
but he is very good with a sledge hammer. Maybe voodoo, too.
