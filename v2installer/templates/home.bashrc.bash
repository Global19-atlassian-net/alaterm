# Alaterm:file=$alatermTop/home/.bashrc
# File /home/.bashrc created by Alaterm installer.

# Most initialization is in /etc/profile  or ~/.bash_profile.
# But do not edit those files unless absolutely necessary.
# If adding custom commands, do it at the bottom of this file.

# This file is sourced at user login, immediately after ~/.bash_profile.
# It is also sourced if you use su to root, then exit to return to user.

# Command prompt, which you may customize:
export PS1='\e[1;38;5;75m[alaterm:user@\W]$ \e[0m'
## If you have any custom ~/.bashrc code, put it below:
