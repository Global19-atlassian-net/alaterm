### NEWS for alaterm at GitHub.

#### UPDATE

On June 30, 2020, alaterm is updated to version 1.2.8.

If you already have alaterm installed, you can apply the update with these steps:
(a) If you retained any of the previous installer scripts, delete them.
(b) Download the latest 00-alaterm.bash script.
(c) Termux command: `bash 00-alaterm.bash install`

Very quick. The update does not re-install.
It merely changes a few files in the existing alaterm installation,
and downloads newer help files.

#### REMINDERS:

To update Termux (not alaterm):  `pkg update`

To update software within alaterm:  `pacman -Syu`

To update alaterm itself, from Termux (not alaterm): `bash 00-alaterm.bash install`

The installer does not re-install, it merely patches. Usually takes only a few seconds.

If you encounter a problem during installation, and have a GitHub account,
be sure to start an issue on this site. I test my code before uploading,
and it works for me. It has been working for over six months now!
If it does not work for you, the fix is probably
something simple such as my failure to upload the correct code.

#### June 30, 2020

Updated to version 1.2.8. Minor code cleanup.

#### June 18-24, 2020

Updated to version 1.2.6.

Tweaked the order of PATH to be more standard.

Added ability to auto-detect TeXLive if installed via TUG instead of pacman.

Revised HELP files.

Changed method of free space detection, to accomodate unexpected results.

#### June 6, 2020

Updated to version 1.2.0.
Fixed problem involving Internet connection check, for some users.
Added some code for use only by developer.
Corrected rarely-used vncserver conflicts.

#### June 1-3, 2020

Updated to version 1.1.2. Not much change, mostly code cleanup.

Removed obsolete python2 packages from installation.
Also removed other unnecessary packages.

Note: If you have xfce4 installed in Termux:
During June 2-3, 2020 there was a temporary problem updating Termux itself.
This is not an alaterm issue. It was fixed within Termux on June 4. 

Fixed: Alaterm installation problem, typically with exit code 73.
Problem occurred during some April-May 2020 installation attempts.
Did not affect users with previously completed installation.
Will not affect new installations, started after this date.

IF YOU HAD THIS INSTALLATION PROBLEM, HERE IS THE FIX (updated):
(a) Remove your existing **0n-alaterm.bash** files, for each **n**.
(b) Download fresh scripts to the same directory.
(c) Run bash 00-alaterm.bash install

The fix does not delete the original Arch Linux ARM files, so
you will not have to download and unpack the archive a second time.

#### April 3, 2020

Fixed: Some users saw several messages about "usepacman #" at alaterm launch.
These messages were harmless. Now removed.

Fixed: Prior to this, if you installed Gedit, it would not save preferences.
Now it will save them. Gedit uses dbus for that, but dbus would not autolaunch.
An automatic dbus-launch has been added to the desktop launcher. 

#### March 10, 2020:

Minor enhancement to prevent double-launch.

#### March 4, 2020:

Minor enhancement to detect Termux-alaterm coordination.

#### March 3, 2020:

Initial public release.

#### March 2, 2020:

Beta testers invited. Should work. Maybe some typos to fix.

#### March 1, 2020:

Final stages of alpha testing. Alaterm certainly works on its developer's device,
and has been working for several months. Currently, help files are being written,
and the scripts are being checked for compatibility when downloaded.

#### February 22, 2020:

GitHub project initialized.

#### Some time in Autumn 2019:

Got alaterm working on my own machine.
I have been regularly using it since then.
