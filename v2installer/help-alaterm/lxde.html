<h4 id="h2.1">2.1. Touchscreen vs. Mouse</h4>

<p class="break">The LXDE Desktop works with touchscreens. First, you move the cursor by
sliding your finger. Then, when the cursor is over its destination, you tap.
The trick: Your finger does not have to be over the cursor.</p>

<p>Since most of the useful applications involve images,
it is best to use Alaterm on a relatively large-screen device,
with external keyboard and mouse.</p>

<p>Mouse right-click is supported, with context menus.</p> 

<p class="top">^<a href="#h">TOP</a>^</p>


<h4 id="h2.2">2.2. Screen Dimensions and Orientation</h4>

<p class="break">The Desktop is initially configured for 1280x800 pixel screens.
This assumes that you use your device in landscape mode, like a laptop.</p>

<p>Many modern devices have high-resolution screens, such as 1920x1200.
However, full resolution will cause everything to appear very tiny.</p>

<p>If you need a different screen resolution, particularly if your device
has an aspect ratio other than 1.6:1, there are two ways to change it:</p>

<p class="li">1. From the LXDE Menu, Preferences, Change Default Resolution.
This offers you a choice of several values.
You can try a value, and if it works for you, save it.
The saved value will then be used each time you login.</p>

<p class="li">2. If none of the choices is what you need, then you can make a
custom choice. This requires using the terminal, rather than the Menu.
Command:<br/>
<code>default-resolution WxH</code><br/>
where W and H are three or four digit numbers,
representing the desired width and height.
The effect is not immediate. To see it, logout then re-launch Alaterm.
If you made a bad choice, you can re-try the command, or use the Menu.
Remember that the initial default resolution is 1280x800.</p>
 
<p>If you set the resolution in landcape orientation,
then it may not fit properly if you rotate your device to
portrait orientation, like a phone. Actual behavior depends on your device.</p>

<p class="top">^<a href="#h">TOP</a>^</p>


<h4 id ="h2.3">2.3. Utilities</h4>

<p class="break">At the left corner of the taskbar is the applications menu.
Use it to launch programs, and to change some preferences.
The initial setup is pre-configured with:</p>
<p>GPicView image viewer</p>
<p>Gnome Font Viewer</p>
<p>Evince PDF document viewer</p>
<p>Gnome Calculator</p>
<p>Leafpad plain text editor</p>
<p>Geany text editor for programmers</p>
<p>GHex hex editor</p>
<p>NetSurf web browser</p>
<p>PCManFM file manager</p>
<p>Preference</p>
<p>Help</p>

<p class="break">Installation of additional software is performed from the
command terminal, as described below.
</p>

<p>The Menu can be edited using PCManFM File Manager.
However, this is not recommended, since it requires some expertise.
</p>

<p>LXDE installs a few utility programs that only work in office desktop
computers. They cannot be uninstalled, since LXDE expects them to be there.
For your convenience, Menu items leading to these useless programs
have automatically been deleted.
</p>

<p class="top">^<a href="#h">TOP</a>^</p>


<h4 id="h2.4">2.4. PCManFM File Manager</h4>

<p>Next to the LXDE Menu is the File Manager, named <b>PCManFM</b>.
Several useful locations are pre-configured as shortcuts:<br/>
<b>Home</b> is your Alaterm home folder.<br/>
<b>Desktop</b> is your Alaterm Desktop, a sub-folder of Home.</br/>
<b>Android Shared</b> leads to the Android directory that contains
Documents, Downloads, Pictures, and other on-device locations
that can be accessed from Alaterm.<br/>
<b>Removable Media</b> leads to an Android directory containing a removable
SD card or USB pendrive, if you have it.<br/>
<b>Termux Home</b> is the home folder for Termux.
This is the initial location when Termux launches.<br/>
<b>Trash</b> leads to Trash at ~/.local/share/Trash.</p>

<p>Note that only Android can mount media.
So if you have a removable media device,
be sure that it is mounted and recognized by Android,
before you launch Alaterm.</p>

<p>Android gives obscure folder names to removable media,
and also includes folders leading to inacessible locations.
Finding your removable device is a matter of trial and error.</p>

<p class="top">^<a href="#h">TOP</a>^</p>


<h4 id="h2.5">2.5. Trash? Rubbish!</h4>

<p>The creator of PCManFM uses the UK term <b>rubbish</b>
instead of the US term <b>trash</b>.</p>

<p>There is no animated Trash Bin.
This is because the necessary software would violate
Android system policies.</p>

<p>The Trash shorcut leads to Alaterm Trash.
It does not include Android Trash, if it exists.</p>

<p>Even though you can send items to Trash easily,
restoring items and emptying the Trash can only be done by command terminal.
File trash-info describes the commands.
It is visible when you enter Trash.</p>
