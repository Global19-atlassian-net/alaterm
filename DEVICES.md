### Additional info

Alaterm does not require root.
It provides no support for rooted devices.

Alaterm cannot be installed to removable media (sdcard, USB).

Alaterm works with touchscreen on phones or tablets, BUT:
The GUI is hard to see and use, unless you have a larger screen (tablet)
and use it in landscape mode (like a desktop computer, not a phone).
Bluetooth keyboard and mouse are supported. Also USB mouse and keyboard.
