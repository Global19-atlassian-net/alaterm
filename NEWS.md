On September 10, 2020, an update to Arch Linux ARM tigervnc software
caused a bug in Alaterm. New installations would fail.
Existing installations, previously working, would fail.

NATURE OF PROBLEM: Some programmer fixed what wasn't broken.

NATURE OF SOLUTION: Alaterm developer whacked it with a sledge hammer.

The solution is likely to be permanent.
Your friendly Alaterm developer does not know much about programming,
but he is very good with a sledge hammer.

If necessary, it will be re-whacked. Wielding a sledge hammer is fun.
