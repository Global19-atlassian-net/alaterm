### NEWS for Alaterm

On September 10, 2020, an update to Arch Linux ARM tigervnc software
caused a bug in Alaterm. New installations would fail.
Existing installations, previously working, would fail.

This is fixed in Alaterm version 2.0.8, scriptRevision 208.

Existing installations must run the Alaterm update. It is quick.

NATURE OF PROBLEM: Someone fixed what wasn't broken.

NATURE OF FIX: Whacked it with a sledge hammer.

The fix is likely to be permanent. Your friendly Alaterm developer does not
know much about programming, but he is very good with a sledge hammer.
