<h3>9. FAQs for Alaterm</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h5>Can I read these help files without using Alaterm?</h5>

<p>Yes. Download the Alaterm ZIP file, and unzip it using Android methods.
Then you can read the pages in your Android web browser app.
Or, if you already installed Alaterm, launch it. Then copy the help files
out to the Android Download folder:</p>
<p class="code"><code>h=/usr/local/help-alaterm</code></p>
<p class="code"><code>cp -r $h $termuxHome/storage/downloads</code></p>
<p>Caution: If you unzip the files using Android, do not use them for
installing Alaterm. Get a fresh ZIP file and unzip it using Termux.</p>


<h5>My device is a phone. Will Alaterm be useful?</h5>

<p>Alaterm works on many phones, but does not interact with phone functions.
It treats any device as a WiFi tablet, whether or not it is a phone.
Alaterm might be visually congested, if your screen is small.</p>


<h5>Can the installer be modified for a Linux distro, other than Arch?</h5>

<p>No. The scripts are very specific to Arch Linux ARM.
Changing a few lines will not enable you to install a different distro.
Reason: Alaterm strives to do one thing well, not many things poorly.</p>


<h5>Why Arch Linux ARM, instead of (say) Ubuntu?</h5>

<p>Most Linux distros do not have a version compiled for ARM processors.
Among those that do, only Arch Linux ARM is kept very up-to-date,
with a good selection of office and graphics programs.</p>

<p>Also, distributions such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint contain
many multimedia programs that will not work in Alaterm,
due to Android limitations.</p>


<h5>Can Alaterm do pentests?</h5>

<p>No. Alaterm is for those who need a GUI, for office and graphics programs.
You can still use the command line for many other things,
but the support structure for pentesting is not configured.
Also, it may not be possible to do pentests from a non-rooted device.</p>


<h5>Why is NetSurf the only web browser in Alaterm?</h5>

<p>Arch Linux ARM provides several browsers, including Firefox,
but they do not work in Alaterm. Even if the software installs and launches,
it may be unable to connect to the Internet. Nothing can be done about it.
However, NetSurf knows how to connect to the Internet within Alaterm.
You can always use Android's multitasking feature to open a native
browser app, while Alaterm continues in the background.</p>


<h5>Can Alaterm run Windows programs using WINE?</h5>

<p>No. But WINE is available as a free Google Play Store app. Works great.
Unfortunately, very few Windows programs are compiled for ARM architecture.
Most of them are text editors, such as Notepad++.
Forget about running ordinary Windows programs using WINE.</p>


<h5>Why does Alaterm not have audio-visual programs?</h5>

<p>Android retains control of your device sound card at all times. Normally,
programs in Alaterm cannot find or access the sound card. So, no sound.</p>

<p>It is possible to hack the audio, but only for some programs.
Hacking is not supported.</p>

<p>Video programs (without sound, unless specially configured) will work
in Alaterm. But they will play much slower, and drop frames, compared
to simply using a native Anroid video app.</p>

<p>Programs requiring connected hardware, such as a MIDI Sequencer,
are out of the question. If Android cannot mount the hardware,
then Alaterm cannot mount it either. And if you can mount it,
Android has a native app designed for the purpose of using it.</p>

<p>The good news: You can do many file manipulations, such as editing
MP3 tags, in Alaterm. You can often change file formats, and do
a variety of tasks via command-line programs such as <b>ffmpeg</b>.</p>


<h5>Are programs, such as GIMP, the same ones used for desktop computers?</h5>

<p>Yes. And, they are very up-to-date.
But your device has limited CPU and memory, which will limit performance.
Some program features may be unavailable,
even though they are shown in the program menus.</p>


<h5>Does Alaterm work with touchscreen, mouse and keyboard, or all?</h5>

<p>All of them.
Bluetooth mouse and keyboard are recommended,
because the programs are designed for desktop computers.
Cable-connected accessories can be used, if Android accepts the connections.
It is possible to draw and edit in GIMP by touchscreen alone,
and possible to use LibrOffice with an on-screen touch keyboard,
but those are very challenging tasks.</p>


<h5>Can Alaterm access data on an external USB hard drive?</h5>

<p>Probably not, unless you can do it in ordinary Android apps.
Device access is always controlled by Android.
If you cannot do it in Android, and Termux, then you cannot do it in Alaterm.
But you can access Bluetooth devices, and USB pendrive.</p>


<h5>Can I boot directly into Alaterm?</h5>

<p>No. Alaterm does not install to a bootable partition.
It is a software sub-system of Termux app.</p>


<h5>Can I print from Alaterm?</h5>

<p>Untested. Probably not.
But you can export your images and documents as file formats (png, pdf, etc.)
and place files in an Android Shared location, where other apps can see them.
Then you may be able to print to a Bluetooth printer, or via Internet.
You can copy the files to a USB pendrive, then print from a computer.</p>


<h5>Can Alaterm open files such as PDF, MS Word?</h5>

<p>PDF is easy. The program is named <b>Document Viewer</b> (Evince).</p>

<p>For something such as MS Word, install <b>LibreOffice</b>.
It can also export most (not all) MS Word formats.
But if LibreOffice is too large for your device,
remember that a variety of Android apps can handle MS Word or
LibreOffice files. Have a look at the <b>Collabora</b> app.</p>


<h5>Help! Android file manager cannot find files saved to Alaterm home.</h5>

<p>This is normal behavior.
Android security forbids its file manager to look into "private" directories.
Your Alaterm home folder is private. So is Termux home.
But you can move a file out of the private area,
to where the Android file manager can see it.
In the LXDE file manager, use the shortcut to <b>Android Shared</b>.</p>

<p>You can also do it via command line. For example:</p>
<p class="code"><code>cp doc.pdf
$termuxHome/storage/downloads</code></p>
<p>That will copy the file to the Download folder in Android.</p>


<h5>Can Alaterm access removable media, such as USB pendrive?</h5>

<p>Yes, but only if Android can access the media.
Within Alaterm, use the LXDE file manager shortcut to Removable Media.
The media directory name will be obscure.
So, you will have to hunt around until you find the correct location.</p>


<h5>Can Alaterm be installed on removable media?</h5>

<p>No. This is an Android security limitation.
Not even if the media is formatted to ext2/3/4.</p>


<h5>In Alaterm, where is the Termux home directory?</h5>

<p>It is a shortcut in the LXDE file manager.
Or command line: <code>cd $termuxHome</code></p>


<h5>In Termux (without launching Alaterm), where is Alaterm home?</h5>

<p>It is <code>/data/data/com.termux/alaterm/home</code></p>


<h5>Once Alaterm is installed, can I discard the "status" file?</h5>

<p>No! Never! The <code>status</code> file records essential information.</p>


<h5>How often is Alaterm updated?</h5>

<p>Alaterm is merely an installer script.
It is occasionally updated for bugs or features.
Installed programs are frequently updated by the Arch Linux ARM project.</p>


<h5>If I uninstall Termux, what happens?</h5>

<p>You simultaneously uninstall Alaterm.
Re-installing Termux does not revive Alaterm.</p>


<h5>Is there a way to re-install Termux, without losing Alaterm?</h5>

<p>Yes! But you do not actually re-install Termux.
Instead, you restore it to "factory" state.
Here is how to do it:</p>

<p><b>Do not</b> uninstall the Termux app.
Without launching Alaterm, type this into Termux: <code>rm -rf $PREFIX</code>
Then exit Termux.</p>

<p>At its next launch, Termux will restore itself, without touching Alaterm.
You will need to add the <code>proot</code> program to the restored Termux.
If you forget to do that, any attempt to launch Alaterm will remind you.</p>

<p>The restored Termux no longer contains the Alaterm launch command.
You can restore it. Termux commands:</p>
<p><code>a=/data/data/com.termux/alaterm</code></p>
<p><code>s=/usr/local/scripts</code></p>
<p><code>cp $a/$s/alaterm $PREFIX/bin/</code></p>


<h5>Can I clean out my Termux home directory, without losing Alaterm?</h5>

<p>Yes! The default installation of Alaterm is not within Termux home.</p>


<h5>Can I install two different instances of Alaterm in a single Termux?</h5>

<p>Yes, but only if you manually edit file <code>globals.bash</code>
to provide a different alatermTop and launchCommand.
This is not recommended. No support is provided.
In any case, only one installation may run at a given time.</p>


<h5>Does Alaterm use Android power management, to save battery life?</h5>

<p>Yes. This is automatic, since Android is always in control.</p>


<h5>Is Alaterm a fork of the TermuxArch project?</h5>

<p>No. Both of them rely on Arch Linux ARM software,
but Alaterm and TermuxArch are very different.
If you wish, you may install both of them, as they are independent.</p>


<h5>Alaterm occupies a lot of space on my device.
Is there a lighter alternative?</h5>

<p>If you need to run heavy programs such as GIMP or LibreOffice,
then you need a heavy installation such as Alaterm.</p>
<p>But if you only need to run lightweight programs, such as Geany or mtPaint,
then the lightweight <code>xfce4</code> Desktop might be your choice.
See the Termux project page (X11 programs) for more information.</p>
<p>Or, if you only need a command-line program
such as <code>pdflatex</code> or <code>ffmpeg</code>,
then you do not need any GUI. They can run directly in Termux.</p>


<h5>If I root my device, does that make Alaterm better?</h5>

<p>I do not know, and do not care. Do not even ask about rooting.</p>
