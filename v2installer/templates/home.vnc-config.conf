# File /home/.vnc/config, created by Alaterm installer.
# You may edit the following geometry if necessary.
# Format is geometry=widthxheight
#   width and height are three or four digit numbers.
#   Landscape mode, like a laptop: width > height
#   Portrait mode, like a phone: width < height
#   Default: 1200x800
# Default works for many 8in to 10.1in tablet screens.
#   Less than pixel resolution. Same aspect ratio.
# For example, 1280x800 works with 1920x1200 screens.
# Edited geometry does not immediately appear.
#   It will be activated at next launch.
# The geometry may be over-ridden by LXDE Menu
#   using Preferences > Monitor Settings.
# Also see file:
#   /home/.config/autostart/lxrandr-autostart.desktop
#   but do not edit. It is automatically generated.

# NOTE: geometry is the only option allowed.
# Any other configuration will be disregarded.

# Do not put space in front of the geometry string. Must be lowercase.
