# File /usr/local/scripts/compile-libde265 created by installer script.
# Use of this script is optional. Only if you need it.
#
# Purpose of this script:
# The libde265 distributed by Arch Linux ARM, and installable to alaterm,
# calls for executable stack. That is an Android security policy violation.
# So, libde265 and any program invoking it will not work in alaterm.
# Those programs involve encoding or decording the heic/heif image format.
# This script compiles an acceptable version of libde265 from source code.
# The compiled version does not call for executable stack, so it works.
#
# Since the h265 format is relatively recent, and libde265 is contemporary,
# there may be updates to libde265 source code as time progresses.
# After compiling and installing the current source code, the installable
# files are retained, as long as you do not delete ~/.source/libde265.
# If a distributed package update installs a non-working libde265,
# you can re-install these compiled files by running this script again.
# Then you do not have to re-compile. But you also will have the choice
# to disregard the existing installables, and re-compile with fresh code.
#
# How to know if libde265, or anything, has a problem with executable stack:
# Install the pax-utils program. Then command:  scanelf -lpqe
# It returns a list of problem files. More info:
# https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/GNU_stack_quickstart
